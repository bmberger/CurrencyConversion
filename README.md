WGHAT I DID WELL: I did a great job on making the calculations for conversions and souvenirs. 
WHAT I DID WRONG AND SOLVED: I at first spaced out all my elements in a weird manner, however,
I slowly made the code and output more organized through trial and error. 
WHAT I NEED TO IMPROVE ON: I need to improve on focusing on looking towards my goal with each task.
